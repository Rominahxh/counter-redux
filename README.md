# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Redux
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript.
In redux we have a global store.
In this global store we will store our data like: user authentication information,
user information or other data.
The data which is used in more than one component.
From that global store we can access that data in all components.
This is the usage of redux.
3 main things in Redux: the reducer, action and store.
